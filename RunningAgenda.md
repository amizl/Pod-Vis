 * review current state
 * Please create a default p value of p < .0001 in POD-Vis. (not p = .0001)
In the current tool, there is no default p value, so unless you notice the options below the analysis, none of the significant results are highlighted in pink.
 * Also, the option to choose another p value needs to be more obvious- we can discuss this during our call today.
 * Focus area for February?
   * cross-sectional data support (meeting on the 28th)
   * user testing (goal is currently end of February, for MII grant)
